      <h3>Project</h3>
      <article><strong>LED Number 4</strong></article>
      <details>
        <p>
          The SST board is a RMIT’s School of Science & Technology’s homegrown
          project, designed and programmed by a group of 4 IT students. The idea
          stems from wanting SST to have a unique and special feeling, like a
          small family. The board is made up of laser-cut mica boards, more than
          3000 programmable LEDs, precise soldering, a Teensy development board
          and, to cap it off, a strong power supply to drive everything and make
          it portable. With careful and manual LED mapping, beautiful animations
          and patterns can be displayed on the board. Not just ourselves, this
          project is the culmination of work from both the teaching staff and
          the technicians from the school and other students as well. We hope
          with this project, more students can be more active and out-spoken
          with their ideas as we had before.
